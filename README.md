# idea-recorder
 A project to improve JS skills

# What is the project?
Well this is a quite simple application (it does not have sessions) which records the ideas or simply say to-do's or anything you wanna call it.
Things that I tried to practice with these projects were:
 <ul>
  <li> IIFE's by keeping the entire code easy to be used anywhere! </li>
  <li> Management of data entered by the user. </li>
  <li> Controlling UI and the App using a medium! </li>
</ul>

# Things used
To convert the code from ES6 to ES5 I have used <b><em>Babel</em></b> and nothing else! Both ES6 and transpiled code is available.
If you see things that are awkward then probably I am editing the project!

Feel free to give me feedback of any sort it will be quite helpful as I learn. And also feel free to use this project any way you want!
